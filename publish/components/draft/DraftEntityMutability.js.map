Generally used in cases where\n *   the text content and the entity do not necessarily have a direct\n *   relationship. For instance, the text and URI for a link may be completely\n *   different. The user is allowed to edit the text as needed, and the entity\n *   is preserved and applied to any characters added within the range.\n *\n * `IMMUTABLE`:\n *   Not to be confused with immutable data structures used to represent the\n *   state of the editor. Immutable entity ranges cannot be modified in any\n *   way. Adding characters within the range will remove the entity from the\n *   entire range. Deleting characters will delete the entire range. Example:\n *   Facebook Page mentions.\n *\n * `SEGMENTED`:\n *   Segmented entities allow the removal of partial ranges of text, as\n *   separated by a delimiter. Adding characters wihin the range will remove\n *   the entity from the entire range. Deleting characters within a segmented\n *   entity will delete only the segments affected by the deletion. Example:\n *   Facebook User mentions.\n */"]}
